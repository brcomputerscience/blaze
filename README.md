In this README, we will guide both newcomers and experienced developers through the key aspects of this project.

This project is made for MontyHacks VII by **Alex Sheng, Dhruv Rakhade, Jay Fang, and Anshuman Roy**.

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blaze.git

## Usage
For Newbies
If you're new to web development or just want to use the application, here's a simple guide:

Open the file uploader by following the "Getting Started" steps.

1. You'll see an input field labeled "Create Wiki." Enter your files here. For example, you can create montgomery.md and make a wiki page about Montygomery!
2. Press the "Create" button, and the file will appear on the internet.

Experiment with different markdown files and see how the wiki database changes in real-time.

## Simplicity

Blaze focuses on a simplistic web design, for maximum user experience, and modern, sleek user interface. With reduced distractions, this carries the purpose, motivation, and essence of Blaze. According to websitemagazine.com, "Simple design makes it easy to draw the viewer's eye to the most important area of the page - and, if you're looking for conversions, that's your call to action. Navigating a cluttered interface is no fun. It can be confusing, overwhelming and frustrating"(Lundin).

## Customization
Experienced developers may want to customize the project further. You can modify the code to change the appearance of the homepage, add additional features, or integrate it into other web applications.

- The Flask code for this project can be found in the app.py file. We also use jQuery for sleek JavaScript operations.

- The code listens for form submissions using jQuery. When the form is submitted, it retrieves the file from the user's computer, and uploads it into our safe and secure database.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
